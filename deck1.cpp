//extern Game * game allows you to access the data from the Game class without the need of creating a new deep copy
//accessing this is called SOFT COPY
//because we are not making a new copy of that class in the HEAP but we are accessing the same set of data
//throughout the program
//you will see this extern Game * game in every other class because it is essential to make the objects interact
extern Game * game;

Deck1::Deck1(QGraphicsPixmapItem *parent)
{
    //the reason why there are flags in this function is because the deck1 spawner in gamesystem.cpp is
    //the same, so everytime it is called it spawns this class
    //putting the flags allow a specific type of Deck1 to spawn
    //flag 1 spawns the shuffling of the deck unto the table
    //flag 2 spawns a fake card after clicking the card, if the getcardDeck array is null(exceeds what you inputted also garbage data)
    //       then it does not appear
    //flag 3 spawns three cards which will stay on the table until the player or the enemy wins war
    //deck1 and deck2 are completely the same the only exception between them is that they move differently
    //the moving that you see is the result of QTimer
    //QTimer allows you to access the timeout function which is visually basically a clock
    //you can set how fast that clock ticks and everytime it reaches midnight it runs a signal that runs a function
    flag = game->gamesys->getDeckFlag();
    //game->gamesys->getDeckFlag()
    //this is an example of accessing the data stored on class game without the need of making a deep copy
    //we can do this because we set extern Game * game at the top so we have global access to this throughout the program
    //game->
    //      is the pointer of the Game class you can name it whatever you want
    //game->gamesys
    //             this means you are accessing another class stored in the game class
    //             this class is the Gamesystem and gamesys is the pointer to that
    //game->gamesys->getDeckFlag()
    //                            this is you accessing the getDeckFlag() function under the GameSystem() class

        //this for example is Qtimer
        //I've set a pointer pointing towards QTimer and it is called timer
        //if you would like to visualize this then imagine a car
        //the car is duplicated, making the 2 cars the same as they possess the same functions
        //the only difference is that the drivers are different and what happens to the other
        //does not affect the other
        //this is called a DEEP COPY
        //we use new QTimer to form a deep copy of this
        //this is called a dynamic variable/object because it was instantiated(made) while the program is ran
        //note that if you were to make these dynamic objects you will always need a destructor(delete)
        //or the RAM/HEAP of your computer will continue to be taken up until it crashes
        //that is what a destructor is for
        //in order to prevent this from happening

        //connect([your time pointer],SIGNAL(timeout()),[the pointer of your reciver/slot | this(if it is in the class],SLOT([function()])
